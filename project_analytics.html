			<p>Problem, Goal, &#38; Audience</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>Our powerful analytics suite is loved by the few data-savvy power users who know how to leverage its many features. However for busy frontline managers who are in back-to-back meetings from 9-5, our solution was overly complex and resulted in our reps losing deals to our primary competitor. Our goal was to remove the feature advantage our competitor held over our analytics solution.</p>

			<p>We targeted frontline sales managers who are end users of this tool as well as sales leaders who influence the buying decision for their organization. <p>

			<p>My Role</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>I spent 6 weeks on generative research, design concepts, usability tests, and delivering final designs of this feature for development. I partnered with a senior PM on the project and communicated with the engineers who developed it. The feature is live to customers and is a new highlight during our sales process.</p>

			<p>Background</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>In sales, analyzing behavioral metrics is one way for managers and leaders to quantitatively measure their teams’ performance. Examples of metrics tracked include: the percentage of time a rep spends talking, the length of their monologues, the number of engaging questions they ask, etc.</p>
			<p>Industry experts recommend generalized targets for some of these metrics, and sales reps and managers will often aim for these to improve their performance. However sales is a blend of structure and art and leaders that blindly follow an industry target may be missing more unique insights into rep’s individual abilities. We wanted to address this aspect of behavioral metrics in our solution. </p>

			<p>Research Learnings</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>I spoke with our internal sales team and customers to learn about the pitfalls of our existing analytics feature. Themes that surfaced included:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li><b>Navigation & visibility:</b> It’s hard to find what I’m looking for. I get lost in the confusing nested dropdown navigation. Key pages I want to return to feel hidden from me.</li><br>
				<li><b>Comprehension & effective storytelling:</b> I don’t know how to get started on this page. What should I search for? I often don’t have a hypothesis in mind (an open search field is daunting, and I don’t know what to do with it)</li><br>
				<li><b>Insight into our audience & their needs:</b> In larger organizations, sales operations and sales enablement frequently use business intelligence tools to perform their own analysis on user data. Their need is for a raw export of data vs. an in-product interface.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Principles</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<ul>
				<li>Simplify the purpose for end-users by organizing information around a <b>single impactful question</b>.</li><br>
				<li><b>Show, don’t hide.</b> This was common feedback across multiple features on our site. Nesting primary pages behind a dropdown menu results in frustration and the feeling of “getting lost” in our product.</li><br>
				<li>Map metrics to outcomes to make them actionable. We needed to provide a way to dissect the data based on whether the deal was ultimately <b>won or lost</b>.</li>

			<p>Testing</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>During testing, our prototype resonated with existing users. We also learned about a usability issue.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Managers appreciated the simplified layout and keeping each charts focused on a single question. They were no longer getting lost in the maze of graphs and nested pages.</li><br>
				<li>A card sorting exercise helped us understand how sales managers preferred to organize the list of available metrics. We landed on the top level categories: <i>Activity, Conversation Skills, Sales Skills, and Topics </i>(words mentioned in a conversation).</li><br>
				<li>Testers loved that comparison views allowed them to benchmarking results by deal stages and sales outcomes (deal won or deal lost). But they were having difficulty locating where to view these comparison dimensions.</li>

			<p>Results</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<ul>
				<li>After rolling out our new Analytics product, we reduced prospects’ objections to our existing offering during the sales process which resulted in fewer deals lost to our competitor.</li><br>
				<li>Our reps felt more confident demoing our new Analytics product to prospects.</li><br>
				<li>During user testing, we also learned that to fully trust and make sense of the metrics we provided, users wanted to be able to “drill down” to the conversation moments that made up the charting data. This would bring clarity to the data and also help diagnose the cause of the results. We incorporated this user request into our roadmap and the feature has since been shipped.</li>
