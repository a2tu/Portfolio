			<p>Goal &#38; Audience</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>Define and design the MVP feature set allowing organizations to customize user role types, permissions to core features, and data access on a need-to-know basis. This project enabled us to start heavily targeting enterprise vs. SMB (small and medium business) organizations, which was a pillar of our operational strategy.</p>
			<p>Our target audience is enterprise customers and customers with sensitive data and strict security requirements. The end user is company admins of these organizations who manage user settings.</p>

			<p>My Role</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>I was the sole designer covering user research, solutioning, and user testing over 3 months. I partnered with a senior PM to define our feature set and led collaborative problem-solving workshops. During development I communicated design requirements with our engineering team, and I helped ensure functional and visual quality before we launched to customers.</p>
			<p>Due to the complexity and system-wide implications of this project we consulted closely with our VP of Product, CTO, and Head of Design throughout the project to reach a well-considered solution.</p>
			<p>This project has been supporting our customers for over a year. We recently launched an iteration to reflect a company’s organizational hierarchy and improve the bulk management of user data for administrators and end users.</p>

			<p>Background</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>At Chorus, one of the defining product values is open access to user data within an organization for self-coaching and personal development.  However, as we brought on customers with larger and more complex teams, we increasingly received requests to include ways to restrict access to sensitive data, better organize openly accessible data for relevancy, and control which features certain user types could use. Without a way for customers to manage user permissions and data access, we were unable to court enterprise prospects with these basic needs.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Adopt the correct paradigm based on existing models that balance usability with scalability</li><br>
					<ul><li>Our foundational problem to solve was to determine whether we would combine user permissions with data access in one set of controls to streamline management, or to separate the settings into distinct features for ease of comprehension.<br><a href=#research-permissions>View results from our user interviews</a>.</li></ul><br><br>
				<li>Dot our Is and Cross our Ts to manage end user impact</li><br>
					<ul><li>As a result of limiting access to features or data, we needed to manage the cross-platform UI/UX impact for end users. We audited the platform to understand how features and access points to data would be impacted before determining the best model for balancing the functional restrictions with a clear user experience.</li></ul><br>

			<p>Research Findings</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p><b>Which Paradigm to Model?</b></p>
			<p>Administrators more easily comprehend the end-user impact of permission and data access settings when the features are separated by user role for permissions and by teams for data access. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>We also found that most common and preferred method of quickly understanding <i>who</i> should be able to view <i>what</i> centered around teams as opposed to their more broadly-defined user roles. For example, “Team C” deals with sensitive financial information for their clients, so Team C’s calls need to be restricted from being accessed by other teams</li><br>
					<li>Roles define functional needs (which are often broadly encompassing) while Teams defined organizational groupings that may include different role types (e.g. a sales manager, sales reps, and customer support managers).</li>

			<p><b>Balance Customizaton with User Impact &#38; the Development Timeline</b></p>
			<p>The promise of flexibility via customization for enterprise clients is a must-have. Organizations want the ability to control any aspect of their Chorus product experience.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Every permission setting has a result on the end-user experience. We needed to carefully define the initial feature set and understand the trickle-out impact on the UI. This helped us curtail endless development time for the MVP.</li><br>
					<li>We prioritized enabling permissions on administrative management settings like user and team management, and coaching and sharing features based on user feedback.</li>

			<p><b>Ease Administrative Management for Data Access</b><p>
			<p>We discovered that system administrators felt less urgency than we did about their efforts in managing permission and data access settings for their organization. They were primarily concerned about having the functional ability and that the options were clear to understand. While there was ample opportunity to improve the usability of bulk management, the first step was to enable permissions on a role level and data access on a team level.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We explored a concept of “groups” to consolidate team settings, but found that it complicated user comprehension. We decided to address large scale user management as an iteration.</li>

			<p>Results</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>We achieved our main goal of unblocking enterprise sales for our team. Along with a pivot in our sales strategy, this product improvement helped us increase our segment of enterprise customers while also expanding our customer base.</p>
			<p>The main usability limitation we identified was the effort involved for admins to manage data access settings on teams individually vs. through a more streamlined process. We addressed this in a future project where we mapped a company’s external organizational user hierarchy into Chorus’ user management system to assist with bulk management through reporting rollups.</p>
