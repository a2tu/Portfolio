			<p>The problem</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>Our GRE mobile study app was only helpful to a small group of users - students who were already well underway studying for the GRE. For students who were still learning about the GRE, our mobile app was beyond their present needs. These early-stage students were also key candidates for converting to our paid GRE subscription.</p>

			<p>A data point illustrating this was that 35% of new users never engaged with a even one piece of content we provided before moving on.<p>

			<p>Business goal</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>In the short term, our team aimed to increase the amount of content new users interacted with. Our goal was to target 3 unique content pieces for 40% of users within 7 days of creating a mobile account. In the long-term, we believed that by addressing the needs of a wider audience coupled with improving how students learned and practiced in the app would lead to increased conversion from the mobile app to our paid core web app product.</p>

			<p>The Team</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>I designed the user experience and interface for this project. I worked with a product manager and a software engineer to come up with new features that addressed pain points for our students. After redesigning the app for the GRE exam, I project-managed rolling out the new design to 10 other mobile apps in the same app suite for other exams. I worked with a team of 3 engineers to accomplish this.</p>

			<p>Our Solution</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>The original GRE mobile app was a collection of videos that taught specific concepts on the GRE. These video lesson are a key feature of our core web product, and we had previously made them available in a mobile app to help students study on-the-go.</p> 
			<p>For new app, our solution was to broaden the usefulness of the product for students who needed to learn more about the GRE before deciding to purchase test prep. We believed that providing students information and resources about how to get started with the GRE would appeal to their needs better than video lessons about concepts alone. We also added practice questions and provided progress tracking to the existing videos to improve the usefulness of the app for serious studiers.</p>

			<p>How we got there</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>To understand the nature of the problem, we started by looking at the data. We learned that over a third of new users who created mobile accounts never watched a single video lesson. Since the original app provided only one possible activity, watching lessons, this was a problem.</p>

			<p>We needed to understand our audience better, so we sat down to user interview a half dozen students in our target audience to learn about what they needed in a study app. We found out that prospective graduate students download multiple test preparation apps to try out early on in their study journey. They weren’t looking for solutions to specific test questions yet, but instead they wanted to learn general information about the test itself: how long it would take to study for, how much it cost, and so forth. We weren’t providing these students the content they needed at this early stage of their studies.</p>

			<p>We also sat down with students who had been actively studying with the mobile video lessons to understand their perspective. What did the like? (The app already had a high app store rating). And what was challenging about studying with the app? Two key points stood out. While students liked the content of the video lessons, they also needed a way to practice test question. Additionally they wasted time trying to determine which videos they had already watched.</p>

			<p>I started sketching out ideas to incorporate new content (articles with resources and exam information) and practice questions with the video lessons.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Design challenges I faced:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New app navigation - originally mapped out by exam section, this format would no longer serve once we included new content</li><br>
				<li>Display introductory content to be immediately visible and captivating</li><br>
				<li>Reorganize video lessons - for easier progress tracking</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Results</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project-body">
			<p>The redesign was a success. We increased 1-month retention by 25% and improved monthly revenue by up to 50%. The new app maintains a 5-star rating in both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.</p>
